# Hatch WordPress Plugin — Changelog

## 0.7.6.0 — 2026-08-13

Release wrap for today's session:

- HatchForms front-end CSS ships with the form block so the input rail no longer inherits raw theme styles.
- WPForms bridge now persists submissions to the WordPress DB (was only pushing to REST echo).
- The Astro-side mu-plugin auto-installs on activation so a fresh WP install does not need a manual step.
- Cloudflare-deploy wizard now honours `mount_mode` end-to-end (Worker source + route + label were previously drifting).
- Admin toggle labels moved to the shared truth source so mismatch between wizard copy and DB key is impossible.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-20

Fixed: REST-lock toggle 404'd the headless frontend. `/hatch/v1/content` and `/hatch/v1/post/{id}/blocks` are now in the public allowlist alongside `/features`, `/menus`, `/seo-meta` — they only return already-public data so the toggle stays safe to flip on.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-20

Cloudflare Workers deploy fix. The Astro starter's middleware had a top-level `setInterval` that the CF Workers v2 runtime rejects (error 10021). Removed; lazy in-handler sweep now keeps the rate-limiter bounded. No plugin-side changes — version bumped to keep the pair in sync.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-20

Post-launch polish — see the root `CHANGELOG.md` for the full release notes.

Plugin-specific fixes:

- `Kill XML-RPC` toggle now hard-403s `/xmlrpc.php` (was 200 with method message)
- `Hide usernames` returns 404 on `?author=N` (was 301 redirect); `/wp/v2/users` independently stripped from REST surface
- `Hide WP from Google` now emits `Disallow: /` in `robots.txt` (was only meta robots)
- `Real-user telemetry` option key wiring fixed (was a silent no-op)
- `CDN asset prefix` removed (returns in v0.2)
- Gutenberg editor URL preview now mirrors the saved slug

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20
